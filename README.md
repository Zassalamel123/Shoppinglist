# Shoppinglist

I wanted to learn more about Android development and to build something useful that you can use.

If you want to go shopping, sometimes you will pick up some paper and write it down what you want to buy.

With this Project I developed an Application where you can write down the items with your smartphone what you want to
buy.

First you create a List where you write down every item you want to buy for today and a Title of your list.
A Json File with items and a Title of your Shopping-List will be created in your smartphone.

After you create the List you can checkmark these items if you press on the name. 

For example, you can checkmark an item if you put it in your basket.
This will be updated in the Json File. 

After you close the Application the checkmarked items will be saved. You can also
uncheck them if you press on this item again.

After working on this project I learned more about Android development, 
writing tests with the mockito framework and also establishing a cicd pipeline to automate tests.
Also following Clean Code, SOLID, TDD (except for the Activities, because testing these was too new and different for me to apply TDD)
principles i wanted to write something that is easy to read and understand.
